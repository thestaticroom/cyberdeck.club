# Feedback Triage

## When to use

- Triaging open feedback issues from the in-app widget
- Categorizing and prioritizing user-reported bugs, feature requests, or UX issues
- Generating a feedback summary or triage report
- Identifying duplicate feedback issues
- Applying labels or triage comments to feedback issues

## When NOT to use

- Managing forum threads, wiki edits, or build moderation — use the appropriate community-manager skill instead
- Creating feedback issues (the widget handles that automatically)
- Anything requiring the cyberdecks.org MCP server — this skill uses the **GitHub MCP server** (`github--` prefixed tools) exclusively

## Repository

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Owner | `thestaticroom` |
| Repo | `cyberdeck.club` |
| Project | `1` (org-level ProjectV2) |

## MCP Tools

All tools use the **GitHub MCP server** (prefixed `github--`).

**Read:**
- `search_issues` — Search with GitHub syntax
- `get_issue` — Full issue details, comments, labels
- `list_issues` — List with state/label filters

**Write (require confirmation):**
- `update_issue` — Update labels, title, body, state, assignees
- `add_issue_comment` — Post triage comments

## Issue Format Reference

Feedback issues created by the widget have:
- **Labels:** `feedback`, `from-widget`, `user:<sanitized_username>`
- **Body fields:** `**Submitted:**`, `**Page:**` (URL), `**Reporter:**` (name + email), `**Admin link:**`, `### Description`, `### Auto-captured Screenshot`, `### User-provided Screenshots`

⚠️ Issues contain PII (reporter email, admin links). **Do NOT reproduce PII in triage reports or comments.**

## Workflow

### 1. Fetch open feedback

Use `search_issues` with query:
```
repo:cyberdeck-club/cyberdeck.club label:feedback is:open sort:created-asc
```

Count total open issues and note the date range. If zero results, report **"Inbox zero 🎉"** and stop.

### 2. Review each issue

For each issue, use `get_issue` to read full details. Extract:
- **Page:** from `**Page:**` field in body
- **Issue description:** from `### Description` section
- **Screenshots:** check for image links
- **Reporter:** from `user:*` label (do NOT use the email from the body)
- **Age:** from `created_at`
- **Existing comments:** check comment count

### 3. Categorize

Assign exactly one category label per issue:

| Label | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| `bug` | Something is broken or not working as expected |
| `feature-request` | User wants new functionality |
| `ux-improvement` | Existing feature works but could be better |
| `content-issue` | Problem with content (wiki, builds, etc.) not code |
| `question` | User is confused or needs help, not a bug |
| `duplicate` | Already reported — link to original |
| `wont-fix` | Not actionable or out of scope |

### 4. Prioritize

Assign exactly one priority label per issue:

| Label | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| `priority:p0` | **Critical** — site broken, data loss, security, auth failures |
| `priority:p1` | **High** — feature broken, blocks user flow, multiple users affected |
| `priority:p2` | **Medium** — UX confusion, cosmetic, nice-to-have improvements |
| `priority:p3` | **Low** — edge cases, minor polish, long-term wishlist |

### 5. Apply labels and comments (with confirmation)

For each triaged issue, **present a summary table to the admin** showing:
- Issue number and title
- Proposed category label
- Proposed priority label
- Affected area (auth, builds, forum, wiki, meetups, admin, feedback, etc.)
- One-line assessment

**Wait for explicit admin confirmation before making any changes.**

After confirmation:
1. Use `update_issue` to add the category and priority labels (preserve existing labels)
2. Use `add_issue_comment` to post a triage comment:

```markdown
## 🏷️ Triage Assessment

**Category:** [category]
**Priority:** [priority]
**Affected area:** [area]

### Summary
[Brief description of the issue and its impact]

### Suggested next steps
- [actionable items]
```

### 6. Handle duplicates

When duplicate issues are found:
1. Comment on the duplicate linking to the original issue
2. Propose adding the `duplicate` label and closing the issue
3. **Wait for confirmation** before closing

### 7. Generate triage report

After processing all issues, output a report in this format:

```markdown
# 📬 Feedback Triage Report — [Date]

## Summary
| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Total Open Feedback | X |
| Newly Triaged | X |
| Bugs | X |
| Feature Requests | X |
| UX Improvements | X |
| Duplicates Found | X |

## Priority Distribution
| Priority | Count | Oldest |
|----------|-------|--------|
| 🔴 P0 Critical | X | [date] |
| 🟠 P1 High | X | [date] |
| 🟡 P2 Medium | X | [date] |
| 🟢 P3 Low | X | [date] |

## Issue Details

### 🔴 P0 — Critical
- **#[number]** — [title] — [category] — [affected area]

### 🟠 P1 — High
- **#[number]** — [title] — [category] — [affected area]

### 🟡 P2 — Medium
- **#[number]** — [title] — [category] — [affected area]

### 🟢 P3 — Low
- **#[number]** — [title] — [category] — [affected area]

## Patterns & Trends
- [common themes across feedback]
- [most affected areas]
- [user sentiment summary]

## Recommendations
1. [prioritized action items]
```

Omit empty priority sections. Do NOT include reporter emails, admin links, or other PII.
