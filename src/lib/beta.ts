      <p>We're reviewing requests by hand (a real person, not an algorithm), so it might take a day or two. We'll email you when you're in.</p>

People making builds in toy cases, vintage purses, compact mirrors, lunchboxes, dinosaur toys, and whatever else sparks joy. If that sounds like your kind of thing, you're probably going to love it here.</p>

      <p>— It's beta. Things might be rough, weird, or broken. That's expected. If something doesn't work, we genuinely want to hear about it — you're helping us shape this.</p>
      
      <p>— This is a space for everyone who makes things. Whether you've been building cyberdecks for years or you just learned what a Raspberry Pi is last week, you belong here. We don't do gatekeeping, we don't do "well actually," and we don't do "real makers."</p>
      
      <p>— The vibe is the vibe. We have a code of conduct (you'll see it during setup). The short version: be kind, don't assume what people know, use the pronouns people give you, and remember that someone's Polly Pocket build is just as valid as someone's milled aluminum chassis.</p>
      
      <p>We're a small crew right now, so your feedback matters a lot. If you have thoughts on what's working, what's confusing, or what's missing, we want to hear all of it.</p>
